# ===================== INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PLUGIN =========================
#
# This plugin provides memory statistics data from NetSNMP and calculates percentage
# of used data based on amount of system/user memory as opposed to also including
# buffer/cache by default as other plugins do (which is a problem for heavily used
# servers where disk cache would end up using all unused memory). There is also
# very pretty and useful graph template available for nagiosgrapher for this plugin.
#
# This plugin also serves as an example of using check_snmp_attributes in a way
# where custom expression is written in an array defined in another plugin which
# then directly calls check_snmp_attributes
#
# ============================ EXAMPLES =======================================
#
# Drop this plugin into plugins directory together with check_snmp_attributes.pl
# If directory is sonething other than /usr/lib/nagios/plugins, make sure to modify
# code (closer to end of this file) to specify correct directory. THIS IS A MUST. 
#
# Here is also an example for nagios config:
#
# define command {
#        command_name check_netsnmp_memory
#        command_line $USER1$/check_netsnmp_memory.pl -L "Memory Utilization" -A '*' -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -C readcommunity -a $ARG1$ -w $ARG2$ -c $ARG3$
# }
#
# define service{
#        use                             std-service
#        servicegroups                   snmp_data
#        hostgroup_name                  linux
#        service_description             Memory Utilization
#        check_command                   check_netsnmp_memory!'total,user,cached,buffer,%used_real,%used_swap,%user_real,%cached_real'!',,,500MB,,65%,65%,'!',,,800MB,,80%,80%,'
